# Social Network API

## Description
A back-end social application using CRUD operations using Mongoose and MongoDB collections. The user of the application can view, create, update, and delete `Users`, `Thoughts`, and `Reactions`.

## Built With
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Express.js
* JavaScript

## Installation
The user must have MongoDB installed and copy the code. After copying the code, the user needs to run `npm i` in the terminal to install all the required npm packages. In order to start the application, run `npm start` in the terminal.

## Usage
After starting the server with `npm start`, the user then can test the routes using a REST client such as 'Insomnia'. The user will then have to look at the routes to see the specific URL's to run the specific requests they want to use. The user can use the routes GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for Users, Thoughts, Reactions, and Friends for Users.
